       TITLE V--POLICY STATEMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

     SEC. 5001. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The rate of economic growth has a significant impact on 
     budget deficits. When the rate of gross domestic product 
     (GDP) increases, projected revenue grows with it and deficits 
     decline. Conversely, slower GDP growth can lead to lagging 
     revenues and mounting deficits.
       (2) Federal policies affect the economy's potential to grow 
     and impact economic performance, influencing budgetary 
     outcomes. Consequently, fiscally responsible policies that 
     improve the economy's long-term growth prospects help reduce 
     the size of budget deficits over a given period.
       (3) The free market, where individuals pursue their own 
     self-interests, has been responsible for greater advancements 
     in quality of life and generation of wealth than any other 
     form of economic system. Federal policies designed to grow 
     the economy should thus allow market forces to operate 
     unhindered rather than pick ``winners'' and ``losers''.
       (b) Policy on Economic Growth.--In the House of 
     Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent 
     resolution to pursue policies that embrace the free market 
     and promote economic growth policies that--
       (1) reduce Federal spending;
       (2) expand American energy production;
       (3) lower taxes that discourage work, savings, and 
     investment;
       (4) deregulate the economy and enact reforms to diminish 
     bureaucratic red tape; and
       (5) eliminate barriers to work so more Americans enter (or 
     reenter) the job market.

     SEC. 5002. POLICY STATEMENT ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUCTION.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with 
     the national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 
     percent of GDP.
       (2) Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 
     percent.
       (3) This debt poses a significant risk to the country's 
     long-term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future 
     generations.
       (4) Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 
     percent of the entire Federal budget.
       (5) The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be 
     $1.9 trillion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
       (6) This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, 
     or 3.2 percent of GDP.
       (b) Policy on Mandatory Spending Reduction.--In the House 
     of Representatives, the goal of this concurrent resolution is 
     to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,"budget 
     window. If the combined deficit reduction provided by 
     authorizing committees is below this target, it is the policy 
     of the Committee on the Budget of the House that the 
     instruction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means of 
     the House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to 
     offset the difference.

     SEC. 5003. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:

[[Page S2257]]

       (1) Regulations throughout the Federal Government have been 
     a major issue for decades, continuously growing while 
     negatively impacting the nation's economic and fiscal 
     standing.
       (2) Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses, 
     strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market 
     conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on 
     taxpayers.
       (3) Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory 
     agencies has increased exponentially since 1960. The total 
     number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has 
     increased from 22,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. 
     When compared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 
     1950, making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was 
     in 1950.
       (b) Policy Statement on Government Deregulation.--In this 
     House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent 
     resolution--
       (1) that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the 
     burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
       (2) that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will 
     reduce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and 
     increase economic prosperity through deregulation;
       (3) to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but 
     to also reassert the role of Congress; and
       (4) to enact legislation through reconciliation that 
     strengthens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits 
     future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, 
     such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of 
     Scrutiny (REINS) Act.
