establishing the 
congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 
2025 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal

follows:
       At the appropriate place
insert the following:
     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO WHETHER 
                   THE PRESIDENT

HAS 
                   UNILATERALLY SUBSTITUTED THEIR OWN FUNDING 
                   DECISIONS FOR THOSE OF THE CONGRESS.
       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate
