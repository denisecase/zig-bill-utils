SEC. 5002. POLICY STATEMENT ON MANDATORY SPENDING REDUCTION.

(a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
(1) The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with the
national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 percent of
GDP.
(2) Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 percent.
(3) This debt poses a significant risk to the country's long-
term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future
generations.
(4) Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 percent
of the entire Federal budget.
(5) The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be $1.9
trillion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
(6) This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, or
2 percent of GDP.
(b) Policy on Mandatory Spending Reduction.--In the House of
Representatives, the goal of this concurrent resolution is to reduce
mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the budget window. If the
combined deficit reduction provided by authorizing committees is below
this target, it is the policy of the Committee on the Budget of the
House that the instruction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means
of the House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the
difference.
