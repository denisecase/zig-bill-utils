SEC. 4007. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

Congress adopts the provisions of this title--
(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall
be considered as part of the rules of each House or of that House
to which they specifically apply, and such rules shall supersede
other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent with such
other rules; and
(2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either
the Senate or the House of Representatives to change those rules
(insofar as they relate to that House) at any time, in the same
manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other rule of
the Senate or House of Representatives.
