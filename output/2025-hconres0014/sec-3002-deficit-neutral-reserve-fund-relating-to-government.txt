SEC. 3002. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO GOVERNMENT
DEREGULATION.

The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may
revise the allocations of a committee or committees, aggregates, and
other appropriate levels in this resolution, and make adjustments to
the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, joint resolutions,
amendments, amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference
reports relating to reducing burdensome and costly Federal Government
regulations by passing legislation focused on government deregulation
that will decrease new spending arising from such regulations and
reassert the proper constitutional role of Congress in the law-making
process by the amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes,
provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit over
either the period of the total of fiscal years 2025 through 2029 or the
period of the total of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
