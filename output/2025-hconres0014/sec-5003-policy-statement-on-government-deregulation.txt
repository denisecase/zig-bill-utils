SEC. 5003. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION.

(a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
(1) Regulations throughout the Federal Government have been a
major issue for decades, continuously growing while negatively
impacting the nation's economic and fiscal standing.
(2) Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses,
strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market
conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on
taxpayers.
(3) Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies
has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of pages
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased from 22,877
pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. When compared to 1950, the
CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950, making the size of the CFR
today 95% larger than it was in 1950.
(b) Policy Statement on Government Deregulation.--In this House of
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution--
(1) that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the
burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
(2) that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will
reduce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase
economic prosperity through deregulation;
(3) to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to
also reassert the role of Congress; and
(4) to enact legislation through reconciliation that
strengthens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits
future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such
as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS)
Act.
